Here at InfluxDB we're building an open source distributed time series, metrics, and events database. Open source time series databases are a ghetto, and we're out to change that. We're based in NYC and SF (soon), but we're looking for developers anywhere in the U.S. Open source software development is distributed and we will be too.

Here are some of the problems we'll be tackling:

* Build a storage engine from scratch designed for time series data.
* Scale Raft out horizontally to work on 1,000 boxes with multiple replication groups.
* Build distributed systems capable of multi-datacenter and rack aware failover and replication.
* Design a distributed processing and scheduling system with Docker as the underlying deployment method.
* Build front end visualization tools for ad-hoc exploration.
* Build front end visualzation tools for other developers to create applications backed by InfluxDB.
* Give talks at user groups and conferences.
* Build consistent APIs across a dozen programming languages and maintain open source libraries.
* Management and operations tools for InfluxDB.

If one or more of those things sound interesting to you, we'd love to hear from you. You don't need to have previous Go experience, just a desire to learn and build great things. On the front-end we're looking for developers that have an eye for design and data visualzations and experience building single page Javascript applications.

We believe in extensive testing, do all our development on [Github](https://github.com/influxdb) and use issues to track things.
