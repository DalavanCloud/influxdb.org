# Deployment

We're still in development mode and plan to have production ready releases by mid February. However, if you're feeling adventurous, somone put together [a Puppet module for InfluxDB](https://github.com/blom/puppet-influxdb) or there's [a Chef cookbook to install InfluxDB](https://github.com/SimpleFinance/chef-influxdb). Or head over to [the InfluxDB download page](/download).

There's also a [docker file for InfluxDB](https://index.docker.io/u/fujin/influxdb/).
